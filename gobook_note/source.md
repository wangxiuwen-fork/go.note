You can download, build, and run the programs with the following commands:

```shell
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/gobook            # choose workspace directory
$ go get gopl.io/ch1/helloworld         # fetch, build, install
$ $GOPATH/bin/helloworld                # run
Hello, 世界

```

Many of the programs contain comments of the form `//!+` and `//!-`. These comments bracket the parts of the programs that are excerpted in the book; you can safely ignore them. In a few cases, programs have been reformatted in an unnatural way so that they can be presented in stages in the book.
